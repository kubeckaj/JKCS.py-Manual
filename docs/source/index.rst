==============================
Welcome to JKCS documentation!
==============================

This is the online documentation for JKCS = Jammy Key for Configurational Sampling.

‚öôÔ∏è `JKCS <https://github.com/kubeckaj/JKCS2.1/>`_
    The JKCS program can be on GitHub. The installation of JKCS also enables JKQC and JKML.

üìö `Installation <https://jkcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JKCSSetupAndInstallation.html>`_
    Click here to see the installation tutorial.

üìç `Citation <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b03853>`_
    I would appreciate if you could cite our paper (see link). Nevertheless, you must cite all papers on the methods and applications you use to study your molecular clusters. (See section Citations.)
